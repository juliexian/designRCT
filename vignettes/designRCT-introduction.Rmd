# Introduction

The designRCT package provides tools for clinical study design, 
including power analysis, sample size calculation, and cost estimation.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(designRCT)
```

## Basic Usage

### Power Analysis
```{r power-example}
# Calculate power for a given sample size
power_result <- power_analysis(
  n_per_group = 95, 
  delta = 0.5, 
  sd = 1.8, 
  R2 = 0.15
)
power_result
```

### Sample Size Calculation
```{r sample-size-example}
# Calculate required sample size for desired power
sample_result <- sample_size_calc(
  power = 0.8, 
  delta = 0.5, 
  sd = 1.8, 
  R2 = 0.15
)
sample_result
```

### Cost Analysis
```{r cost-example}
# Estimate study costs
cost_result <- cost_analysis(
  n_per_group = 95,
  cost_per_subject = 1000,
  fixed_costs = 50000,
  dropout_rate = 0.1
)
cost_result
```

### Comprehensive Study Planning
```{r sample-size-example}
# Complete study planning
complete_plan <- plan_study(
  scenario = "sample_size",
  power = 0.8,
  delta = 0.5,
  sd = 1.8,
  R2 = 0.15,
  cost_per_subject = 1000,
  fixed_costs = 50000,
  dropout_rate = 0.1
)
```
