\arguments{
\item{scenario}{Character. Either "power" (calculate power for given n) or
"sample_size" (calculate n for given power)}

\item{n_per_group}{Integer. Number of subjects per group (for power calculation)}

\item{power}{Numeric. Desired power (for sample size calculation)}

\item{delta}{Numeric. Expected effect size (mean difference)}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Pooled standard deviation}

\item{R2}{Numeric. Proportion of variance explained by covariates. Default is 0}

\item{sig.level}{Numeric. Significance level. Default is 0.05}

\item{alternative}{Character. "two.sided" or "one.sided". Default is "two.sided"}

\item{cost_per_subject}{Numeric. Cost per subject. Default is NULL (no cost analysis)}

\item{fixed_costs}{Numeric. Fixed study costs. Default is 0}

\item{dropout_rate}{Numeric. Expected dropout rate. Default is 0}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print detailed results. Default is TRUE}
