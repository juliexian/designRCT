\usage{
power_analysis(
  n_per_group,
  delta,
  sd,
  R2 = 0,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_per_group}{Integer. Number of subjects per group}

\item{delta}{Numeric. Expected mean difference between treatment and control}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Pooled standard deviation without covariate adjustment}

\item{R2}{Numeric. Proportion of variance explained by covariates (0-1).
Default is 0 (no adjustment)}

\item{sig.level}{Numeric. Type I error rate (alpha). Default is 0.05}

\item{alternative}{Character. One of "two.sided", "one.sided". Default is "two.sided"}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints detailed results. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A list containing power analysis results with components:
\itemize{
  \item power: Statistical power (1 - beta)
  \item n_per_group: Sample size per group
  \item total_n: Total sample size
  \item delta: Effect size (mean difference)
  \item sd_original: Original standard deviation
  \item sd_adjusted: Adjusted standard deviation after covariate adjustment
  \item R2: Variance explained by covariates
  \item sig.level: Significance level
  \item alternative: Test alternative
}
}
\description{
Calculates statistical power for two-sample t-tests with
  optional covariate adjustment to reduce residual variance.

\examples{
# Basic power analysis without covariate adjustment
power_analysis(n_per_group = 95, delta = 0.5, sd = 1.8)

# Power analysis with covariate adjustment
power_analysis(n_per_group = 95, delta = 0.5, sd = 1.8, R2 = 0.15)

# One-sided test with verbose output
power_analysis(n_per_group = 95, delta = 0.5, sd = 1.8,
               R2 = 0.15, alternative = "one.sided", verbose = TRUE)
