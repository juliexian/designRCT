\title{Sample Size Calculation with Covariate Adjustment}
\usage{
sample_size_calc(
  power,
  delta,
  sd,
  R2 = 0,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{power}{Numeric. Desired statistical power (between 0 and 1)}

\item{delta}{Numeric. Expected mean difference between treatment and control}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Pooled standard deviation without covariate adjustment}

\item{R2}{Numeric. Proportion of variance explained by covariates (0-1).
Default is 0 (no adjustment)}

\item{sig.level}{Numeric. Type I error rate (alpha). Default is 0.05}

\item{alternative}{Character. One of "two.sided", "one.sided". Default is "two.sided"}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints detailed results. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A list containing sample size calculation results
}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size per group to achieve
  a specified power level, with optional covariate adjustment.

\details{
Calculate Required Sample Size for Given Power

\examples{
# Calculate sample size for 80\% power
sample_size_calc(power = 0.8, delta = 0.5, sd = 1.8)

# With covariate adjustment
sample_size_calc(power = 0.8, delta = 0.5, sd = 1.8, R2 = 0.15)
}
